A browser game using HTML Canvas and JS

## What is it?
2D tile based game using HTML, CSS and JS. Features:

* 🔗 Two-player setting (with different key bindings, two players sharing one keyboard)
* 🎥 Changeable camera view (either player 1 or player 2) 
* 💖 Numerous interactions (talking, planting, cutting, eating...)
* ✨ Animations
* 💬 Dialogues
* 👛🪓⛏️🔨 Inventory and collectible tools
* 🤗 Gathering resources and using them to build things

## Tiles:

The tiles are conceptually drafted (with placeholder texts), for an immersive experience a thorough design would be required.

## Deployment:
Currently it is a simple HTML/CSS/JS website, nothing to worry about.
