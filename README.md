## Tiles:

The tiles are conceptually drafted using placeholder texts, it should just serve as a proof of concept.

## Build/Development:
Currently the goal is to migrate the project's structure using [ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
Alongside development [Live Server Plugin for vs code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is used, as modules development requires a server from which the files will be requested from ([see also the following link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts)).

## Deployment:
Modules are natively supported in most modern browsers ([for details refer also "caniuse"](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)).
